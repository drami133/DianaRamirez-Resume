        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Diana and I am nineteen years old. My favorite hobbies include cooking, reading, and eating. Fun facts about me are that I have broken and/or fractured about thirteen body parts,all which have by far been worth it. My favorite sport to watch and play is soccer. I have about fourteen years of experience with it. I love the feeling I get when racing across the field faster than I can think. The adrenaline runs from my toes to the tips of my hair and swoosh, the ball zig-zags, and then,..GOAL! Aside from my personal feelings, I love soccer because it is a team sport. We, as in my soccer teams, depend on each other for every play to happen, and without the motivation the long and exhausting physical training days would be lucrative instead of ecstatically memorable. We have friendly competitions and by far are always driven to do better than the last time. This includes through the close bonding and physical qualities of the sport. Aside from those fun activities, I do dedicate the majority of my free time to my education. <br><br>
  I have been interested in psychology since I was ten years old, and have recently been more motivated to take part in providing mental help services since four students in the Chaffey Joint Union School District had committed suicide within the first two weeks of my senior year in high school. My main goal is to become specialized in post traumatic growth fields or child development, so that children can become emotionally stronger human beings and overall be able to radiate with hope. Every day I hear different negative responses to how people’s days are going. My personal beliefs have taught me to openly remind people around me that every day should be valued as if it were our last. That is why I not only want to complete my college career but instead, want to inspire children to live vividly so that they may become strong adults. I for one have experienced minor set backs as a child, but thanks to counseling have learned new physical, verbal, and emotional ways to cope with my feelings both alone and with the help of others. This is an imperative concept for the human world to continue living peacefully, especially after this 2020 pandemic. <br><br>
    I also chose mental health as a career because it is something that every human in any age, race, or stage needs to consider, including myself. Two of my attributes that I am trying to improve are my anxiety and my perfectionism.The steps I follow to be productive in my mental and physical ways are the following: first, contemplating, second, making a choice, and third, is finding an optimistic reason as to how whatever approach will shape me. As cringe worthy as it sounds, everything happens for a reason. Many reasons actually. Whether religion, science, or the greater good of the universe is what guides us through life we have only one. It should be worthwhile. Learning and sharing psychology has taught me that peace and altruism are the keys to a happy and long life.
